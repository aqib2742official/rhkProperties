Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then update `.env.local` with your actual credentials:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-actual-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=info@rhkproperties.com
```

### 2. **Get Gmail App Password**

**Steps to generate:**
1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Navigate to **Security**
3. Enable **2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled)
4. Search for **App Passwords**
5. Select **Mail** and **Other (Custom name)**
6. Name it "RHK Properties Contact Form"
7. Click **Generate**
8. Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)
9. Paste it in your `.env.local` as `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

## üîç Why It Works on Vercel

‚úÖ **Serverless Functions**: Your `/api/contact` route runs as a serverless function  
‚úÖ **SMTP Support**: Nodemailer works perfectly in Vercel's Node.js runtime  
‚úÖ **Free Tier**: No costs for API routes (within limits)  
‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Secure storage for sensitive credentials

## üìä Vercel Free Tier Limits

Your contact form is well within free tier limits:

| Feature | Free Tier Limit | Your Usage |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Serverless Function Execution | 100GB-hours/month | ~0.001 GB-hours per email |
| Invocations | 1 million/month | Likely < 1,000/month |
| Bandwidth | 100GB/month | Minimal (text data only) |

**Conclusion**: You can handle **thousands of contact form submissions per month** on the free tier.

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Local Testing (Before Deploying)

```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Visit: http://localhost:3000/contact
# Fill and submit the form
# Check your terminal for any errors
```

### Production Testing (After Deploying)

1. Visit your deployed site's contact page
2. Submit a test form
3. Check `info@rhkproperties.com` for the email
4. Check Vercel logs:
   - Go to your project ‚Üí **Deployments**
   - Click on the latest deployment ‚Üí **Functions**
   - Click on `/api/contact` to view logs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Missing required environment variables"

**Solution**: Make sure all three env variables are set in Vercel dashboard and redeploy.

### "Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"

**Solution**: You're using your regular Gmail password instead of an App Password. Generate a new App Password.

### "535 Authentication credentials invalid"

**Solution**: 
- Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Gmail account
- Generate a fresh App Password
- Remove any spaces from the 16-character password

### Emails not arriving

**Solutions**:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` is correct in Vercel env variables
3. Check Vercel function logs for errors
4. Ensure your Gmail account can send emails (not suspended)

### Function timeout on Vercel

**Solution**: This is rare, but if it happens:
- Check if your Gmail account is blocked/locked
- Verify network connectivity (Vercel has good uptime)
- Check Vercel status page: https://www.vercel-status.com/

## üîí Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Never commit `.env.local`** - It's already in `.gitignore`  
‚úÖ **Use App Passwords** - More secure than regular passwords  
‚úÖ **Rotate credentials periodically** - Generate new App Password every 6 months  
‚úÖ **Monitor usage** - Check Vercel analytics for unusual activity  
‚úÖ **Input validation** - Already implemented in the API route  
‚úÖ **Rate limiting** - Consider adding if you get spam (use Vercel's edge config)
